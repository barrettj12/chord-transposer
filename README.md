# `chord-transposer`
`chord-transposer` is a simple web app for transposing a chord progression into another key.
The user inputs plain text into a textbox, containing their chords and possibly formatting data.
The chords are extracted from the plain text, transposed into the desired key, then outputted
on the webpage.

You can try it out <a href="https://barrettj12.github.io/chord-transposer/" target="_blank">here</a>.
